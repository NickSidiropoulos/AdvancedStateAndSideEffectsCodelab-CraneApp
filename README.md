Advanced State in Jetpack Compose Codelab - Crane App
=====================================================

This Codelab helped me learn advanced concepts of state and side-effect APIs in a Jetpack Compose app!
Learned bout how to create state holders, side effect APIs such as LaunchedEffect, rememberUpdatedState, DisposableEffect, produceState, and derivedStateOf, and how to use coroutines in Jetpack Compose.
